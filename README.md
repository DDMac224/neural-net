# Neural Network

A very basic neural network written in rust. This is the final for my Math for Data Science course. It is written using mostly the standard library.

Currently back propagation has not been implemented, so it is just running through random weights.

# Installation

First make sure that rust and git are installed.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/DDMac224/neural-net.git
cd neural-net
cargo run
```
